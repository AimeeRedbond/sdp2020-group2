  <h4>Mobile impaired people demanding assistant</h4>
  <div class="tag">
    <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jar/2011/708510/#abstract">Study </a> has shown that mobility disability, defined as “when impairments in mobility restrict the 
    ability of individuals to move about in their natural environment in order to carry out activities essential to daily life”, can significantly impair people's quality of life including 
    physical, mental and cognitive health. There are over 
    <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/overviewoftheukpopulation/august2019#toc ">11 million people in the UK</a>  
    alone with a limiting long term illness, impairment or disability. Among them, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936657419300433?casa_token=9Hp4OmrX6NUAAAAA:E1uRGCVuxudQRd-5wz40tcSY1DX359S0M2RlJPFAeOVJreOKN42i4yknA_94y4_m5v8xXWBbJco">
      majority are <b>above 65</b> and the most common causes are arthritis, rheumatism and back or spine problems, in total accounting for <b>40%</b>. </a> 
    One of the major issues for these individuals is moving while carrying objects.  Elderly people, especially those living alone have a difficult time in their living environment. According to the 
    <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20131101163230/http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/disability-statistics-and-research/disability-equality-indicators.php">national survey</a> 
    , more than <b>70%</b> of people believe that older people demand support for them to live independently at home and one in five disabled people find adaptations made to their 
    accommodation unsuitable or unsatisfactory. Therefore, our product, aiming to allow the user to have more control within their own home by easing their dependence on assistive living and 
    the need for home adaptation, has a huge potential market.</div>
  <h4>Compare with similar products</h4>
  <div class="tag">Currently, there are three types of robots in the market similar to ours: the restaurant server robot, the outdoor food delivery robot and the cargo carrying robot.  
    Each of them shares a few similarities with our robot, but none of them simultaneously possess all the necessary properties for a home use carrying robot for mobility impaired people.</div>

    <h6>Alibaba's food waiter robot</h6>
    <div class="image_container">
      <img src="/images/food_server.webp" alt="alibaba" class="image">
      <div class="overlay">
        <div class="text" >Alibaba's new restaurants use robot waiter to serve their customers. It also target for indoor food transmitting.
          However, because it is designed for restaurants, this robot is not qualified for our use case. In order to effectively navigate to customers,
          it requires a specialised track to operate on, which it is not feasible to build for majority of home.

    <h6>Bear Robotics' waiter robot</h6>
    <div class="image_container">
      <img src="/images/bear_robot.png" alt="bear" class="image">
      <div class="overlay">
        <div class="text" >This robot waiter is more flexible in terms of mobility and shares a similar outlook as ours.
          The major advantage of our robot is supporting human following and custimized robot configuration i.e. user can adjust tray's height when placing/removing food. 
          On the contrary, the robot waiter only has a fixed height to place the food, making it harder for customers to move the food to irregular table. Hence, the fact 
          that our robot places food on a lift enables the robot to deal with this variation.

    <h6>Food delivery robots</h6>
    <div class="image_container">
      <img src="/images/food_delivery.jpeg" alt="deliver" class="image">
      <div class="overlay">
        <div class="text">Food delivery robots are able to transmit packaged food from restaurants to customers. They are designed for food delivery with a 
          lot of extra features to guarantee food safety, resulting in much higher price for each robot. Also, its colony working mode, i.e. a number of robots collaborate 
          with each other, requires a large central server to schedule each robot’s task. Neither is there a way for users to customize or manipulate nor is the robot suitable 
          for personal use. </div>

    <h6>Gita cargo carrying robot</h6>
    <div class="image_container">
      <img width="400" src="/images/gita.jpg" alt="gita" class="image">
      <div class="overlay">
        <div class="text">This cargo carrying robot can follow the user while moving. It keeps track of user's moving trajectory by . On the other hand, our robot traces the infrared beacon’s signal holding by the user, which means users don’t need to 
          purchase any additional wearable devices and further development may even remove this requirement by implementing object-localisation based on camera video. 
          Also, the user has to bend over to get their stuff from this robot, which is inconvenient for our robot’s target audience-people with mobility impairments.</div>
