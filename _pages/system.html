  <h4>Mobile impaired people demanding assistant</h4>
  <div class="tag">
    <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jar/2011/708510/#abstract">Study </a> has shown that mobility disability, defined as “when impairments in mobility restrict the 
    ability of individuals to move about in their natural environment in order to carry out activities essential to daily life”, can significantly impair people's quality of life including 
    physical, mental and cognitive health. There are over 
    <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/overviewoftheukpopulation/august2019#toc ">11 million people in the UK</a>  
    alone with a limiting long term illness, impairment or disability. Among them, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936657419300433?casa_token=9Hp4OmrX6NUAAAAA:E1uRGCVuxudQRd-5wz40tcSY1DX359S0M2RlJPFAeOVJreOKN42i4yknA_94y4_m5v8xXWBbJco">
      majority are <b>above 65</b> and the most common causes are arthritis, rheumatism and back or spine problems, in total accounting for <b>40%</b>. </a> 
    One of the major issues for these individuals is moving while carrying objects.  Elderly people, especially those living alone have a difficult time in their living environment. According to the 
    <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20131101163230/http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/disability-statistics-and-research/disability-equality-indicators.php">national survey</a> 
    , more than <b>70%</b> of people believe that older people demand support for them to live independently at home and one in five disabled people find adaptations made to their 
    accommodation unsuitable or unsatisfactory. Therefore, our product, aiming to allow the user to have more control within their own home by easing their dependence on assistive living and 
    the need for home adaptation, has a huge potential market.</div>
  <h4>Compare with similar products</h4>
  <div class="tag">Currently, there are three types of robots in the market similar to ours: the restaurant server robot, the outdoor food delivery robot and the cargo carrying robot.  
    Each of them shares a few similarities with our robot, but none of them simultaneously possess all the necessary properties for a home use carrying robot for mobility impaired people.</div>

    <h6>Alibaba's food waiter robot</h6>
    <div class="image_container">
      <img src="/images/food_server.webp" alt="alibaba" class="image">
      <div class="overlay">
        <div class="text" >Alibaba's new restaurants use robot waiter to serve their customers. It also target for indoor food transmitting.
          However, because it is designed for restaurants, this robot is not qualified for our use case. In order to effectively navigate to customers,
          it requires a specialised track to operate on, which it is not feasible to build for majority of home.

      <img src="/images/bear_robot.png" alt="bear" class="image">
      <div class="overlay">
        <div class="text" >This robot waiter is more flexible in terms of mobility and shares a similar outlook as ours.
          The major advantage of our robot is supporting human following and custimized robot configuration i.e. user can adjust tray's height when placing/removing food. 
          <br>On the contrary, the robot waiter only has a fixed height to place the food, making it harder for customers to move the food to irregular table. Hence, the fact 
          that our robot places food on a lift enables the robot to deal with this variation.

    <h6>Food delivery robots</h6>
    <div class="image_container">
      <img src="/images/food_delivery.jpeg" alt="deliver" class="image">
      <div class="overlay">
        <div class="text">Food delivery robots are able to transmit packaged food from restaurants to customers. They are designed for food delivery with a 
          lot of extra features to guarantee food safety, resulting in much higher price for each robot. <br>Also, food delivery robot is supposed to work with a number of similar robots collaboratively, 
          which requires a large central server to schedule each robot’s task. Neither is there a way for users to customize or manipulate each robot independently nor it is suitable 
          for personal use. </div>

      <div class="overlay">
        <div class="text">This cargo carrying robot can follow the user while moving. It keeps track of user's moving trajectory by . On the other hand, our robot traces the infrared beacon’s signal holding by the user, which means users don’t need to 
          purchase any additional wearable devices and further development may even remove this requirement by implementing object-localisation based on camera video. 
          Also, the user has to bend over to get their stuff from this robot, which is inconvenient for our robot’s target audience-people with mobility impairments.</div>

  <h4>Integrated with smart home system, a brand new market</h4>
  <div class="tag">The potential of embedding the N.E.A.T robot into a smart home system makes our robot unique in the market. In the past few years, there has been an increasing 
    trend in development of smart home devices and personal assistant robots, especially for the old or mobility impaired groups. These people usually experience dramatic hardship in 
    accomplishing daily tasks like holding stuff firmly while walking. On the other hand, <a href="https://diysmarthomeguide.com/complete-guide-smart-home-technology-elderly/">smart home devices</a> 
    are  “easy-to-use” and aim for automatic living experience which is more accessible to the general public. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1729881418759424">Study</a>  has been done 
    in investigating the potential application of combining robotics and smart home IoT. and exploring building assistant robots in a 
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6891406/">dynamic smart environment</a>. Companies have already developed a number of smart home devices for old people 
    including smart locks, smart Lighting, automated Thermostats, and Leak Detection. Despite the increasing popularity of smart home devices, there isn’t any commercial product that integrates 
    good carrying robots into a smart home ecosystem. Therefore, our product, N.E.A.T. is capable of opening a new market area. </div>

  <center><h1>Potential for future development</h1></center>
  <ul>
      <li class="fut_dev">Augment the Android app with<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/wifi-rtt"><b> WiFi localization</b></a> for better user experience. 
        It enables the robot to localise the user within the room when it is woken up from idle mode. Therefore, the user can place the robot anywhere in the house for charging or placement. 
        When the user want to use the robot, he or she can invoke the robot while preparing food. Then the robot will navigate itself to the user and be ready for carrying food after a while.
        </li>
      <li class="fut_dev">Implement <b> computer vision algorithms</b> for object detection and recognition in the future. 
        <br>
         There are two potential benefits:
         <ol>
             <li class="fut_dev_inside">First, we can fully get rid of the infrared beacon when following and give the user more freedom when using our robot. <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2018/7068349/">Deep learning algorithms </a> will be integrated into our system for object localisation, i,e. identify an object and isolate it from the rest of objects including background within an image. Thus, the robot is able to follow the user based on analysing the image from the camera.</li>
             <li class="fut_dev_inside">In addition, adding camera based object detection allows the system to support indoor mapping. In combination with WiFi localization on the app, the robot is able to come to the user from any place in the house.</li>
         </ol> 
         </li>
      <li class="fut_dev">Implementation of <b>battery lifetime notifications</b> that allow the user to get a time estimate of the remaining time (not just a percentage) that the robot can work for before requiring charged</li>
      <li class="fut_dev">Implementation of a <b>“home docking system”</b> that would charge the robot during downtime with minimal human interaction</li>
      <li class="fut_dev">Integrate the robot with existing home automation devices together to enhance the <b>smart home ecosystem</b>. Currently, the mobile phone has to be in the same local network 
        to connect to the robot. With the help of other smart home devices, the user can remotely control the robot. It can then extend to more complicated use cases beyond just 
        carrying food between kitchen and dining room. For instance,imagine the user is heading back home from shopping, the user can ask the robot to come to the door by talking to a smart 
        home interface installed on his or her mobile phone when he or she finishes shopping. The command will be propagated to the robot in the house by the central hub that connects to the internet. When the user arrives at 
        home, the robot will be in front of them ready to carry stuffs. </li>
