        <h1>Team Management</h1>
        <p>We decided from the beginning of this project to split our team into two main subteams, with a focus on software and hardware respectively. This split was maintained throughout the project, with some members moving subteam according to our goals for that particular milestone. We found this flexible approach to be very effective. In each subteam, there were further divisions; the hardware team consisted of those focused on the base and the lift, whereas the software team broke down into those working on the robot software, the mobile application and the communication protocol between the robot and the app.</p>
        <p>We organised a weekly meeting with our group mentor to reflect on our progress over the previous week and allocate tasks for the week ahead. We then organised additional team or subteam meetings throughout the week as the need arose. The two most important tools we relied on throughout this project were GitHub as our version control system and Slack as our primary means of communication. We had Slack channels for the different subteams and various other key topics, such as meetings and demos. We also allocated a channel for daily check-ins; this was our answer to the daily stand-up used in Agile development. Each day, every member of the team would give a brief summary of what they had worked on and what they planned to tackle next. This was a great way of monitoring our progress, and also essential for identifying bottlenecks and issues as they arose, helping us to deal with them more efficiently. Our other tools were Microsoft Teams for team meetings once we switched to remote working, and Trello for task management. Here we placed the main goals for each demo which was very useful for prioritising tasks and keeping track of our progress.</p>
        <p>At the outset of this project, we created a preliminary Gantt chart which outlined the breakdown of tasks and the dependencies between them. This was restructured very early on, once we actually began working on the project. The updated chart was useful for reminding us of what needed to be done and how these various tasks were related to one another.</p>
